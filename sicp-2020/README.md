# SICP Walkthrough

This is where I left study notes on [SICP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs).

## How it works

1. Write notes using Bear app.
2. Convert markdown from Bear to be more suitable for GitHub using [bear-to-github markdown converter](https://github.com/turastory/bear-to-github-markdown)
